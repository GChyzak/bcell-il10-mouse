Activated B cells can regulate immunity through interleukin(IL)-10 production. The differentiation of IL-10-producing B cells and their development for cell therapy have been limited by the lack of a protocol to efficiently generate these cells. To overcome this limitation, we performed a high-throughput screen and identified small molecules enabling the induction of quasi-pure and stable IL-10-producing B cells. These B cells cured recipient mice from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis within a few days upon administration at the peak of disease. Their therapeutic effect involved their accumulation in the central nervous sytem of treated mice, required IL-10 receptor signaling in microglia and was independent of their interaction with CD4+ T cells. This study reports the generation of induced regulatory B cells (iBregs) for therapy against inflammatory diseases.
